# Description

This repository contains various scripts that I've written to help me automate tasks. 


## renameFiles.py
This is a python script that I wrote to parse the name of a file, and then update it to something a bit more readable.

### Prerequisites
All that's needed here is python 3. I developed it using 3.12.1

### Usage: 

1. Download the file
2. Change to directory where you downloaded it
3. Run the script using the command 'py renameFiles.py <PATH>
